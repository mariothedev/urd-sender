### Urd Sender
A Node.Js script that sends you words to learn from Notion to your cell number using Twilio API.  

### How to use
Create an .env file with the same properties found on .env-example file and insert the tokens and ids needed.

### Requirements
* Notion account
* Twilio account
* Cell phone number

#### Notes
After realizing how expensive Twilio's API is, I've decided to make a Telegram BOT instead. Same functionality will be implemented but without all the costs of using Twilio's API.
